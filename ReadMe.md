#### Requirements

* pytorch >=0.4.0
* torchvision ==0.2.0
* Jupyter Notebook

#### Datset 
* A distribution of 1D GMM having five mixture components with modes at 10, 20, 60, 80 and 110, and standard
deviations of 3, 3, 2, 2 and 1, respectively.

#### Usage
* Run the Simple_GANs.ipynb to generate the results for vanilla GAN.
* For MAD-GAN run the Mad_GANs.ipynb to compare the results of vanillaGAN over MAD-GAN.

#### Results
